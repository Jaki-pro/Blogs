## Managing State with `useState`, `useReducer`, and Redux

# _We can handle state management using useState, useReducer hooks. Then why we are gonna implement this shit Reduxüò≠. Wait!! Today I'm gonna reply some questions like this and ommit your shit confusionsüòÅü•≥_

### Using `useState` what we can do:

- **Simple State Management**: Ideal for managing simple state logic.
- **Component-Level State**: Typically used for managing state within a single component.
- **Ease of Use**: Very easy to set up and use for straightforward state scenarios.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using `useReducer` what we can do:

- **Complex State Management**: Suitable for more complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous state.
- **Predictable State Transitions**: Uses a reducer function to define how state transitions happen, similar to Redux reducers.
- **Local State or Shared State**: Can be used for both local component state and more complex shared state management, although it does not provide out-of-the-box solutions for global state management like Redux.

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return initialState;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Comparing to Redux:

Redux may compel you to write some awkward built in structured code but trust me when you will go for a big project work, Redux will be a life savior for you handling state management accross your project components and make your state logic very easier and simple to understand by any developer instead overriding same code thousands of times as useState and useReducer do

- **Global State Management**: Redux is specifically designed for managing global state across your entire application, whereas `useState` and `useReducer` manage state at the component level.
- **Middleware and Enhancers**: Redux offers middleware (like redux-thunk and redux-saga) for handling side effects and enhancers for extending its functionality, which are not available with `useState` and `useReducer`.
- **DevTools Integration**: Redux integrates with Redux DevTools for advanced debugging and state inspection, providing a powerful toolset for development.

## When to Use Each:

- **useState**: For simple, component-specific state.
- **useReducer**: For complex state logic within a component or shared among a few components.
- **Redux**: For complex applications requiring a global state management solution, especially when you need middleware, enhancers, or DevTools integration.

  In summary, while you can manage state using `useState` and `useReducer`, Redux provides a more structured and scalable approach for larger applications with complex state management needs.
