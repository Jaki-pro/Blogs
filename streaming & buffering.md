 # This blog is the visualization to help understand the concepts of streaming and buffering in terms of Data Transmission: #
 **Streaming:**
  - In the streaming scenario, imagine a river flowing steadily from left to right. The data (represented by water) is continuously flowing from the source (left) to the destination (right) in a steady stream.
   - As the data flows, it is divided into smaller, manageable chunks, allowing it to be transmitted in real-time.
   - Users (represented by the person on the right) can start consuming the data as soon as it arrives, without needing to wait for the entire file to be transmitted.
  
**Buffering:**
- In the buffering scenario, imagine a reservoir (the buffer) positioned between the source and the destination.
- As data is transmitted from the source, it is stored temporarily in the buffer.
- Once a sufficient amount of data has been buffered (the reservoir is filled to a certain level), playback or consumption can begin.
- As consumption continues, more data is transmitted from the source to replenish the buffer, ensuring a continuous and smooth stream of data.
  
This visualization illustrates how streaming involves the continuous transmission of data in real-time, while buffering helps smooth out variations in the transmission rate, ensuring uninterrupted playback or consumption of the streamed content.
